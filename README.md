this is Room Database Migration Guide

## Why do i need this?
So the app won't have any crashes when the database schema changes, while having the old data in the old database


## How do you actually did it?
### Here's how

1. With you current entity tables and room version, add

in order to generate you current database schema, sync gradle then run the app.

2. Do the changes you want to the entity tables, but make sure you put the default value if you want to add new column using @ColumnInfo, also change the version number.
    for example :

 4. Add the automigration delcaration on your Database class, for example : 
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91923470/192080107-31a38477-6f96-410c-98b6-d8d3b1b1c390.png)
 
 here, i want to migrate from version 1 of my database, to version 2 of my database. run the app, and don't worry there will be a runtime error, but with that runtime error the app will generate your database schema.

 4. Adjust the database schema
 After the runtime error, you'll have 2 .json files of your database schema, you can find it here :

 but as if right now, the 2 of .json files will be the same, because it generates during the runtime error, so what you have to do right now?
 - delete the json file for your previous version (in my case is 1.json)
 - undo the changes that you do on your database schema
 - revert the version back to the previous version (in my case is version = 1)
 - run the app, and that will generate the actual database schema for your previous database version

 5. Re-do the changes you made 
 
 results :

 the top one is the old data, the bottom one is the new data. And there you go, now there are new column called "age" and the default value is 0
 now i know, this isn't the most efficient way to do migration, but this works for me. And if you found the better way of doing this, i hope you willing to share it with me
 And that's pretty much it for the migration, i hope this helps
